## Overview and Origin

* What is the name of the company?
<br>Google Pay (GPay)

* When was the company incorporated?
<br>Initially started in 2015 in India, then merged into Google Wallet in 2018 to evolve it

* Who are the founders of the company?
<br>Sujith Narayanan and Sumit Gwalani

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
<br>While "Google Wallet" focused on being a mobile payment system on Android devices, the evolution of "Google Pay" transformed the app into a strictly peer-to-peer payment system. GPay was initially created to provide access to financial transactions in India and Singapore in 2018, then adapted to the US market in 2020. Its business model consists of 3 parts: Mobile Recharges (recharge sim card funds), Bill Payments (pay any bill online), and UPI Transaction (conduct point-of-sale transactions with a merchant).

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
<br>GPay is fully funded by Google as an internal project, so did not go through independent rounds of funding

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
<br>Provide quick, easy, and secure way to pay online and transfer funds, rather than having to wait and deal with lengthy and cumbersome bank transfers in some areas.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
<br>As of April 2023, GPay had 150 million users across 40 countries; representing 8.34% of the market for online payment

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
<br>Industry-leading security: GPay encrypts data so payment info stays safe in transit
<br>Advanced fraud alert technology: GPay uses machine learning to identify phishing and other fraud risks when you send and receive money
<br>Links to existing user information: GPay incorporates Google Chrome's autofill feature making it the simplest way to make payments quickly
<br>Pre-existing customer base: Most mobile devices use Android, so GPay has an unfair starting point

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)
<br>GPay relies on a form of Near-Field Communication (NFC) called Host Card Emulation (HCE) to transmit credit card information between the user’s mobile phone to the card reader. This technology does not require access to a secure element embedded in the phone like Apple Pay, and instead card data is stored in the cloud. Android is an open source code with thousands of versions, so the secure element is not a viable solution.
<br>

## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
<br>GPay, as a mobile payments app, falls under Embedded Finance, which is part of the Payments/Billing domain

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?
<br>A couple of recent trends include:
    * Businesses that offer embedded finance saw increased revenue and plan to spend more on the tech in the future
    * The pandemic highlighted the need for embedded finance and drove adoption
    * SMBs are divided on how to offer embedded solutions but the majority have regrets related to implementation
    * Organizations across business models and industries find embedded finance especially valuable during a recession
    * Payment solutions and consumer-oriented products are the most appealing to SMBs
<br><br>

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
<br>GPay's key competitors are PayPal, Apple Pay, Stripe, CashApp, Venmo, Zelle, Samasung Pay, AliPay, Wise, Paytm, and PhonePe

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
<br>
    * Money sent directly to your bank account with no fees
    * Business-only rewards
    * Customers can make payments using phone number and QR code
    * Enhanced transaction details that show you how much you’ve earned on Google Pay
<br><br>

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
<br>Some key metrics include:
    * Mobile payments users by app: the number of users using the service
    * Mobile payments app market share: percentage of transaction volume
    * Mobile payment revenue: proceeds from the service
    * Mobile payment revenue growth: revenue trends over time
<br><br>

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
GPay's performance in the key success metrics above is notable, as it comes in fourth in "Mobile payments users by app" globally; however, many of these metrics are not consistently measured across competitors globally and in some cases depend on given countries. For example, GPay and Apple Pay are not readily available in China and GPay is a dominant player in India.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
<br>Given the immense potential of AI, I strongly believe that GPay should consider integrating AI in its application, in order to develop an accurate picture of user spending (both in terms of type and volume)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
<br>GPay can leverage this capability to suggest additional brands/merchants that pay GPay a subscription to be included in a list of potential matches, this way, GPay can directly monetize UPI Transactions, which is currently free for both consumers and merchants.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
<br>Google has developed Bard as its Generative AI solution, and that or other internal AI modules could be integrated into GPay

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
<br>AI is fit for purpose to learn an individual's preference based on past behaviors. Additionally, AI can initially be used to make generic suggestions to consumers then customize them for each individual
